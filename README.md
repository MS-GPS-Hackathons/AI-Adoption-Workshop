# Workshop: Designing an End-to-End Azure AI Solution

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2025-04-10  

## Overview

This workshop guides participants through the end-to-end process of designing a secure, scalable, and governed AI solution on Microsoft Azure, aligning with the Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF) and Azure Well-Architected Framework (WAF) principles.

Starting with a realistic customer scenario (Innovate Financial Services - IFS), participants will first design the foundational Azure platform using Azure Landing Zones concepts, including a specialized AI Hub for governed access to AI services. Subsequently, they will design a specific AI workload ‚Äì an internal RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) chatbot ‚Äì that leverages this platform foundation.

**Goal:** To equip participants with the knowledge and design patterns necessary to architect robust enterprise AI solutions on Azure, from the underlying platform infrastructure to the specific AI application components.

## Modules

### Module 1: Understanding the Business Need (CAF: Strategy & Plan)

**Objective:** Analyze the customer's (IFS) business drivers, challenges, goals, and specific AI use cases.

**Activities:**  
- Review the customer story.  
- Identify key objectives, success metrics, and initial high-level requirements.

**Materials:**  
- [Customer Story](./wds/ifs-customer-story.md)

---

### Module 2: Designing the Azure AI Platform Foundation (CAF: Ready, Govern, Manage | WAF: Security, Reliability, OpEx)

**Objective:** Design a secure, scalable, and well-governed Azure foundation using Landing Zone principles to support IFS's current needs and future AI adoption. This includes designing a central, secure "AI Hub" for managing and accessing shared AI services like Azure OpenAI and Azure AI Search.

**Activities:**  
- Define platform requirements (security, governance, connectivity, AI service management).  
- Design the Landing Zone structure (Platform & Application LZs).  
- Architect the AI Hub with private networking (Private Endpoints, secure gateway).  
- Select core platform services.

**Key Concepts:**  
- Subscription democratization.  
- Identity management.  
- Network topology (Hub-Spoke).  
- Private networking.

## Key Principles Emphasized

- **Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF):** Applying guidance across Strategy, Plan, Ready, Adopt, Govern, Manage, and Secure phases.  
- **Well-Architected Framework (WAF):** Designing solutions considering the five pillars: Cost Optimization, Operational Excellence, Performance Efficiency, Reliability, and Security.  
- **Security:** Defense-in-depth, private networking, identity-based access control, secure secrets management.  
- **Governance:** Centralized policy enforcement, cost management, resource organization.

- **Automation:** Utilizing Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and CI/CD practices.

---

## Prerequisites

- Familiarity with fundamental Azure concepts (Subscriptions, Resource Groups, Networking, PaaS services).  
- Basic understanding of AI/ML concepts (LLMs, RAG is helpful but not essential).  
- Experience with architectural design discussions.
